## Notes
- All file uploads are stored locally in `/app/server/uploads/`
- For production deployment on Render, you may want to consider:
  - Using cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary) for files
  - Setting up CDN for uploaded files
  - Configuring proper CORS for file access
- AI features require the Emergent LLM key to be active
- Socket.IO is configured for both WebSocket and polling transports
